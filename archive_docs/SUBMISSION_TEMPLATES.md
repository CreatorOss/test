Best Agent for Complex Codebases
```

**Description**: 
```
A revolutionary multi-AI democratic security platform that orchestrates complex enterprise security decisions through consensus-based AI collaboration. Features 7 microservices, 3 AI agents with democratic voting, military-grade encryption, and real-time monitoring - perfect for managing complex enterprise codebases.
```

**Use Case**: 
```
Enterprise Security Orchestration for Complex Codebases

The Final Sendec System addresses the critical challenge of managing security across complex, multi-service enterprise architectures. Traditional security systems rely on single points of decision-making, creating vulnerabilities and bottlenecks.

Our solution introduces democratic AI governance where three specialized AI agents (Coordinator, Guard, Interpreter) collaborate to make security decisions through consensus voting. This approach:

1. Eliminates single points of failure in security decision-making
2. Provides specialized expertise from each AI agent
3. Ensures robust security through distributed cryptography
4. Scales across complex microservices architectures
5. Maintains real-time coordination across 7+ services

Perfect for enterprises managing complex codebases with multiple services, distributed teams, and critical security requirements.
