🚀 Excited to share my submission for the Qodo Build Your Own Agent Challenge!

I've developed the Final Sendec System - a revolutionary multi-AI democratic security platform specifically designed for complex enterprise codebases.

🎯 What makes this special:

🤖 **Democratic AI Governance**: Three specialized AI agents (Coordinator, Guard, Interpreter) collaborate through consensus voting to make critical security decisions. No single point of failure!

🏗️ **Enterprise Architecture**: Real-time orchestration of 7 microservices with production-ready scalability and monitoring.

🔐 **Military-Grade Security**: AES-256-GCM encryption, RSA-2048 signatures, and Shamir Secret Sharing for distributed key management.

🗳️ **Consensus Protocol**: 2/3 quorum requirement ensures robust decision-making across distributed systems.

📊 **Production Ready**: 100% test coverage, comprehensive documentation, and complete CI/CD deployment package.

This system addresses real challenges in managing security across complex, multi-service enterprise architectures. Traditional systems create bottlenecks with single decision points - our democratic AI approach eliminates these vulnerabilities while scaling seamlessly.

Perfect for the "Best Agent for Complex Codebases" category! 🏆
