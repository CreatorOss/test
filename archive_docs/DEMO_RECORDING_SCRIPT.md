## üé¨ **DETAILED RECORDING SCRIPT**

### **üéØ SCENE 1: OPENING (30 seconds)**

**[VISUAL: Clean desktop with terminal ready]**

**NARRATION:**
```
"Hi! I'm Benny Harianto, and I'm excited to present the Final Sendec System 
for the Qodo Build Your Own Agent Challenge.

This is a revolutionary multi-AI democratic security platform that demonstrates 
how AI agents can collaborate to manage complex enterprise security scenarios.

What makes this special is that three AI agents - a Coordinator, Guard, and 
Interpreter - work together democratically to make critical security decisions."
```

**ACTIONS:**
- Show clean desktop
- Display project title overlay
- Show your name and contact info

### **üèóÔ∏è SCENE 2: ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW (45 seconds)**

**[VISUAL: Terminal showing system startup]**

**NARRATION:**
```
"Let me show you the architecture. The system features 7 microservices 
orchestrated by a master controller.

Watch as I start the system - you'll see all services come online: 
the core Sendec server, three AI nodes, token services, and security components.

Each service has a specific role, but they all work together through 
JWT authentication and Shamir Secret Sharing for distributed security."
```

**ACTIONS:**
```bash
cd sendec-server
npm start
```

**SHOW:**
- Terminal output showing all 7 services starting
- Highlight each service as it comes online
- Point out the different ports and PIDs

---

### **üéÆ SCENE 3: DEMO INTERFACE (60 seconds)**

**[VISUAL: Browser with demo interface]**

**NARRATION:**
```
"Now let's see the interactive demo interface. I've created this Matrix-themed 
interface to showcase the system's capabilities.

Notice the real-time Matrix effect in the background - this isn't just for show, 
it represents the continuous data flow between our AI agents.

Here you can see all 7 services are running and healthy. Each AI node reports 
its status independently - the Coordinator is active, the Guard is monitoring 
with normal security levels, and the Interpreter is ready."
```

**ACTIONS:**
- Open final-sendec-client.html in browser
- Show the Matrix effect
- Point out the service status display
- Highlight each AI node's status

---

### **üó≥Ô∏è SCENE 4: DEMOCRATIC VOTING DEMO (75 seconds)**

**[VISUAL: Demo interface with voting demonstration]**

**NARRATION:**
```
"Now for the most innovative feature - democratic AI decision making. 
Let me demonstrate the self-destruct voting protocol.

When I click 'Cast Self-Destruct Vote', the system generates a JWT token 
for the Coordinator AI and submits a vote to the quorum system.

Watch the log - you can see the vote being processed. The system requires 
2 out of 3 AI agents to agree before any critical action is taken.

This prevents any single point of failure and ensures that critical security 
decisions are made democratically by multiple AI perspectives."
```

**ACTIONS:**
- Click "Cast Self-Destruct Vote" button
- Show the log output in real-time
- Explain the JWT generation process
- Point out the quorum threshold

**SHOW IN LOG:**
- JWT token generation
- Vote submission
- Quorum status update

---

### **‚ö° SCENE 5: ADDITIONAL FEATURES (45 seconds)**

**[VISUAL: Demonstrate other features]**

**NARRATION:**
```
"The system also includes attack simulation for testing security responses, 
and real-time key rotation for maintaining security.

Let me trigger an attack simulation - this tests the system's ability to 
detect and respond to threats in real-time.

And here's the key rotation feature - the system can refresh its cryptographic 
keys on demand, ensuring continuous security even in long-running deployments."
```

**ACTIONS:**
- Click "Trigger Attack" button
- Click "Force Rotate Seeds" button
- Show the responses in the log

---

### **üîê SCENE 6: SECURITY HIGHLIGHTS (30 seconds)**

**[VISUAL: Terminal showing technical details]**

**NARRATION:**
```
"What makes this enterprise-ready is the combination of military-grade 
cryptography with AI democracy.

We use AES-256-GCM encryption, RSA-2048 signed JWT tokens, and Shamir 
Secret Sharing with a 3-of-5 threshold for distributed key management.

The system has 100% test coverage and is designed for production deployment 
in complex enterprise environments."
```

**ACTIONS:**
```bash
# Show some technical details
curl http://127.0.0.1:6000/status
curl http://127.0.0.1:4003/status
```

**SHOW:**
- JSON responses from APIs
- Service health indicators
- Technical specifications

---

### **üéä SCENE 7: CLOSING (15 seconds)**

**[VISUAL: Final system overview]**

**NARRATION:**
```
"The Final Sendec System represents the future of AI-powered security - 
where multiple agents collaborate democratically to protect complex systems.

This is perfect for the 'Best Agent for Complex Codebases' category because 
it demonstrates enterprise-scale AI coordination.

Thank you for watching, and I'm excited to contribute to the Qodo ecosystem!"
```

**ACTIONS:**
- Show final system status
- Display contact information overlay
- End with Qodo hashtag: #QodoAgentChallenge
